# Coming up with ideas:
I had six different ideas for a utility app they were:
1.	An app that allows you to store recipes that you can easily access, it would also include a way to store information and create or edit recipes. It can also help you with hobbies, by keeping track of what step you are on like the thread count number. 

2.	A Journal app that I put images on for what day instead of writing.

3.	Walking app that can be personalized to my specifications. That tracks my process checking what activity I need to do to keep fit. Give reminders to do the exercise. 

4.	An app to help with learning coding, that becomes progressively more advanced.  

5.	An app that helps the elderly with technology. 

6.	App for people with ADHD that can help them self-regularity.


Choosing the best three: 

1.	 List recipe/hobby app: 
I wanted a list, recorded information app for storing recipes and hobby techniques. Simple and user-friendly, that stores information that can be accessed easily on the go and edits the information when better methods such as new ingredients for the recipe for different ratios. The hobby part would be especially useful for counting the number of rows for the projects as there is no app like it at the moment.

2. Coding App: 
There is a lack of simple and intermediate coding apps that teach self-coding. If this app is implemented it will increase the amount of understanding of coding in this technological world.   

3. ADHD – ASD self-regulating app: 
There is a surprising lack of Apps, to help children self-regulate. Having ADHD and ASD myself I know firsthand how hard it is to self-regulate. (To calm down and stop feeling anxious.) It would be good to have an app that can grow with you as you get better at regulating maybe with games, images and music (music videos) using the child’s interests. 

Choice: 
I chose the list recipe app because it is easiest to implement and has the most potential and I have an idea of how it's going to function and work. Also, I need this app and make sure every else its it as well because I haven't seen a recipe app that allows you to create your recipes and edit them, there is a lot of potential for this app.
