# Pratical 01
Name: Matthew Ballarino

# Learning Activities
For the first week of the Prac, I focused on mastering Kotlin. I started by studying a series of PDFs designed to teach Kotlin programming concepts. After gaining familiarity, I proceeded to develop my own project, the "Pizza Program." This involved implementing object-oriented principles, specifically using abstract classes, and defining features such as toppings and additional options.


# Estimated Hours
 
I dedicated approximately 8 hours and 30 minutes to learning and implementing Kotlin code this week.

# Content Insights

 - I gained valuable insights into Kotlin's object-oriented features, particularly appreciating the benefits of using interfaces and abstract classes for code reusability.

- I explored Kotlin's handling of null relationships.

- I briefly delved into Kotlin's data classes. 


# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This practical experience provided me with essential resources to deepen my understanding of Kotlin, a highly sought-after language in app development. This proficiency enhances my employability by distinguishing me from other candidates in the job market.
