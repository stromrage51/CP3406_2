# Pratical 02
Name: Matthew Ballarino

# Learning Activities
For the second week of the Prac, I focused on learning the ins and outs of Android Studio as I would be using it in further lessons. I started by familiarising myself with the Program called "Andriond Studio" by reading a selection of PDFs designed to make me familiar with using Andriond Studio to create mobile apps. After getting the API on the right level for usage and familiarising myself with tools, I developed a simple app that allows you to roll a dice and give a random number every time to test my skills. The dice app tested my skills using Android Studio. Â 


# Estimated Hours
I dedicated approximately 3 hours to learning and discovering Android studio works this week.

# Content Insights
- I explored Android Studio features to understand how it works. 

- I gained valuable insight into the development of mobile apps. 

- I gained insight on connecting app view to the actual Kotlin programs.


# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This practical provided me with knowledge on how to use Android Studio to create mobile apps, which is a highly sought-after skill as a lot of devices use mobile apps. This new skill set enhances my employability by distinguishing me from other candidates in the IT job market.
